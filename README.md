Scripts for the manuscript entitled "Neural oscillations suggest predictive timing during auditory beat processing in the premature brain".

Note that the Matlab analysis script requires a running version of the EEGLAB toolbox (https://github.com/sccn/eeglab.git), Fieldtrip toolbox (https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip.git), and circStat toolbox (https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab.git).

There are three .mat files to run the Stat.m:

ChannelsNeighbouring.mat: shows the neighbours of each channel

ForStrength&Phase.mat: two cells: (1) channels * subjects: strength. (2) channels * subjects * repetition of surrogate

EEG_StimPhaseDifference: channels * subjects: phase values
